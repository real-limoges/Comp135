Old code from Grad School - this is for a course called "Machine Learning and Data Mining."  I learned Python for this class (the first assignment is actually my first non-"Hello World" script!)

Take the code in here with a grain of salt; we were not allowed to any packages. Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and even Numpy were not allowed during the course of the class. Any linear algebra had to be reasoned without using these libraries.
