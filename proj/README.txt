Final Project


Assignment Design Provided in Writeup.pdf

To Run:

bash RUNME.sh



Notes:  

In the directory there must be a dataset named 'dataset1.arff' and
'dataset2.arff'

There will be two additional files created that store the output to the
screen. These contain my confusion matrices, number of items in each fold,
number of iterations to find epsilon, etc...  Feel free to read these.
I promise they are (relatively) easy to read.
